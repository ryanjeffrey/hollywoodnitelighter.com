How do you refresh a brand that has done the same thing since 1948?
Our strategy involved two main goals:
1. Highlight the impressive client base to build prospective client trust.
2. Use tools that are cutting edge in 2022.
We used several fun tools for this project, including Blender for 3D art, and Three.js for 3D development. We collaborated with the Hollywood Nite Lighter team to achieve a fun and luminous 3D searchlight spinning animation. The user can interact with the lights by clicking and dragging to control the spin. At the bottom of the experience, we highlight the client list using a rolling marquee. Fun, clean, and effective.
